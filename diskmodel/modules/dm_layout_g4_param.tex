IDX contains a list of g4 layout index nodes which are themselves
represented as lists of integers. The inner lists contain the index
entries which have 8 fields as follows:
lbn, -- the lbn of the first instance, relative to the parent
cyl, -- the lowest cylinder in the first instance, relative to the parent
runlen, -- the number of lbns this entry covers
cylrunlen, -- the number of cylinders for this entry
len, -- the number of lbns in one instance of the child
cyllen, -- the number of cylinders covered by one instance
childtype, -- whether the child is an index node (IDX) or track pattern (TP)
child -- index of the child node in IDX or TP
The entries are given inline so the inner lists will have a multiple
of 8 entries.
The last index node (last entry in the outer list) is the "root" index
node that covers all of the LBN and cylinder space.
